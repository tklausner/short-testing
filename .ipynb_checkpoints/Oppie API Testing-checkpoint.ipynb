All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \"Oh, how beautiful!\" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. \"Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay.

    "**Input Text:** Forests are a great bulwark against climate change, so programs to reduce deforestation are important. Those efforts usually focus on stopping the destruction in areas where it is already occurring. But a new study suggests these programs would do well to also preserve forests where deforestation and degradation haven’t begun. Gradual loss of these largely pristine, intact forests has a much greater climate impact than previously accounted for, the researchers said. Globally, forests take more than a quarter of the carbon emissions from human activities out of the atmosphere every year. Intact forests are especially effective at storing carbon — although only about 20 percent of tropical forests are considered relatively pristine, they are responsible for about 40 percent of carbon storage in the tropics. The study, by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Queensland in Australia and other institutions, analyzed carbon emissions from the loss of intact tropical forests worldwide from 2000 to 2013. What on Earth Is Going On? Immediate clearing of intact forests, what might be considered  classic  deforestation, over that period accounted for about 3 percent of global emissions from deforestation in all tropical forests, the researchers said. But when they looked at other, more gradual types of loss and disturbance — forests that had been opened to selective logging for firewood, for example, or road-building that exposed more trees to drying or windy conditions — they found that the carbon impact increased sixfold over the period. It’s alarming, because there are huge amounts of intact forest being disturbed every year,  said Tom Evans, who leads the forest conservation program at the Wildlife Conservation Society and was a co-author of the paper, which was published in Science Advances. Worldwide in the first decade and a half of the 21st century, about 9 percent of intact forests were opened up to degradation and deforestation. The study amounts to a more complete accounting of the carbon impact of forest loss. Some of the impact comes not from newly accounted-for emissions but from what the researchers called  forgone removals  — a degraded or disturbed forest takes up less carbon from the atmosphere than a fully intact one. These forests are working for us each year, soaking up large amounts of carbon,  Dr. Evans said.  But we don’t account for that when the damage happens. International programs like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD+, are seen as a way to help limit global warming by using financial incentives to halt ongoing deforestation, thus conserving forests’ carbon-storing capabilities. But Dr. Evans said the new study showed that protecting still-undamaged forests could have a strong climate benefit as well. From a number of different angles there’s a rising realization that we need to do more than just the core REDD approach,  Dr. Evans said. For one thing, if preserving an intact forest has a climate impact six times greater than previously thought, perhaps the financial incentive to preserve it should be substantially higher, he said. I’m not sure the answer is to change REDD,  Dr. Evans added.  I suspect there’s probably some complementary approach that can be used.\n",

    "**Input Text:** My dear Sister,  I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced on my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am, however, in good spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.  No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.  One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.  Adieu, my dear Margaret.  Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.  I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.  But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.  Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?  My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must finish.  Heaven bless my beloved sister!  R.W.\n",

    "**Input Text:** It was during his second summer at Walden that Thoreau made his first visit to the Maine woods. It was probably in response to a request from Horace Greeley that he wrote out the narrative from his journal, for Mr. Greeley had shown himself eager to help Thoreau in putting his wares on the market. In a letter to Emerson, January 12, 1848, Thoreau writes:  I read a part of the story of my excursion to Ktaadn to quite a large audience of men and boys, the other night, whom it interested. It contains many facts and some poetry.  He offered the paper to Greeley at the end of March, and on the 17th of April Greeley responded:  I inclose you 25 for your article on Maine scenery, as promised. I know it is worth more, though I have not yet found time to read it; but I have tried once to sell it without success. It is rather long for my columns, and too fine for the million; but I consider it a cheap bargain, and shall print it myself if I do not dispose of it to better advantage. You will not, of course, consider yourself under any sort of obligation to me, for my offer was in the way of business, and I have got more than the worth of my money.  But this generous, high-minded friend was thinking of Thoreau's business, not his own, for in October of the same year he writes,  I break a silence of some duration to inform you that I hope on Monday to receive payment for your glorious account of 'Ktaadn and the Maine Woods,' which I bought of you at a Jew's bargain and sold to _The Union Magazine_. I am to get 75 for it, and as I don't choose to _exploiter_ you at such a rate, I shall insist on inclosing you 25 more in this letter, which will still leave me 25 to pay various charges and labors I have incurred in selling your articles and getting paid for them,--the latter by far the most difficult portion of the business.  \n",
